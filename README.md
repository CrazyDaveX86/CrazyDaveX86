# Welcome to the Chaos

This isn’t a portfolio it’s a warzone. I write code that breaks systems and rewires how they’re supposed to work. If you're looking for clean, cuddly projects, leave now.

## Who Am I?

A programmer who doesn’t waste time pretending to care about rules.
The person who finds bugs and turns them into weapons.
Self-taught. Relentless. Probably smarter than you.

## What I Do

Build tools to make attackers cry and defenders sweat.
Play with low-level code like it’s a sandbox.
Write, break, and fix software—usually in that order.

## Tech Stack

C, C++, Python, Assembly (x86/ARM) , Go, Linux, Windows. Everything else is just noise. I don't fucking use RUST because i already write memory safe code

## Why I’m Here

To create, destroy, and leave a mess behind.
If you think you can keep up, fork something. If not, move along.

~ Competence speaks for itself everything else is just static.
