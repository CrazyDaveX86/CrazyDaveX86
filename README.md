# OffSec Developer Extraordinaire  
**Braaains? Nope, Code!**  

Hey there, I'm the Crazy Dave of Offensive Security! A little quirky, a little wild, but always focused on the missionâ€”crafting exploits, building tools, and taking security to the next level.  

## What I Do  
- Malware Maestro: Crafting sneaky yet elegant malware (for educational purposes, of course).  
- Red Team Wizardry: Finding doors where others see walls.  
- Cyber Sleight-of-Hand: Turning the impossible into "oh snap, it works!" moments.  

## Tools in My Garage  
- Custom RATs & C2 Frameworks  
- Kernel Shenanigans  
- Endpoint Busters  

**Remember**: Stay sharp, stay sneaky, and always have a backup taco.
